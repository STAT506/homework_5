HW 5
================

1.  Simulate data from a “random slopes, random intercept” model
    framework.

2.  Create a plot that displays the simulated data, in this figure
    ignore the groups.

3.  Now create a figure (faceted and/or colored) that highlights the
    group differences.

4.  Fit the model and compare the estimated values with simulated values

5.  Make predictions for a new observation at an existing group, let x =
    0

6.  Make predictions for new observation in a new groups, let x = 0
